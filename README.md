# dotfiles
My configuration dotfiles.

You could probably use [dotfriles](https://github.com/hawkw/dotfriles/commits/master) to install these, if you want to.

This requires [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), an excellent framework for managing zsh configurations. Install oh-my-zsh first and then add my `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom` directory on top of the existing oh-my-zsh install.
