  "line_padding_bottom": 3,               //  should be at least = 3 to align properly with the fold icon & search/quick panel line height
  "line_padding_top": 3,
  "margin": 3,

  "caret_extra_width": 2,                 //  to have a wider/thicker caret
  "caret_extra_bottom": 3,                //  to make the caret = to the line height
  "caret_extra_top": 3,

  "overlay_scroll_bars": "enabled",       //  to show scrollbars only when scrolling
