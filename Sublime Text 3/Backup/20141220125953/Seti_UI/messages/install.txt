---------------

Activate the UI theme and color scheme by modifying your user preferences file, which you can find using the menu item `Preferences -> Settings - User` in Sublime Text or get `Schemr` & `Themr` by [Ben Weier](https://github.com/benweier).


> Example
```
{
  "theme": "Seti.sublime-theme",
  "color_scheme": "Packages/Seti_UI/Scheme/Seti.tmTheme",

  "caret_extra_width": 2,                 //  to have a wider/thicker caret
  "line_padding_bottom": 2,               //  should be at least = 2 to align properly with the fold icon
  "line_padding_top": 2,
  "margin": 2,

  "overlay_scroll_bars": "enabled",       //  to show scrollbars only when scrolling
  "highlight_line": true,                 //  to highlight the current line
}
```

- please check the readme for more theme options.

- copy the (fold.png) "or edit it if you want" to (Packages/Theme - Default) to override the _focken default yellow icon.

- for better recognition of file types, its recommended to install [Applyâ€‹Syntax](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/ApplySyntax) by facelessuser.
