# Install
---------------

Activate the UI theme and color scheme by modifying your user preferences file, which you can find using the menu item `Preferences -> Settings - User` in Sublime Text or get `Schemr` & `Themr` by [Ben Weier](https://github.com/benweier).


> Example
```
{
  "theme": "Seti.sublime-theme",
  "color_scheme": "Packages/Seti_UI/Scheme/Seti.tmTheme",
  "caret_extra_width": 2 // to have a wider/thicker caret,

  "Seti_mouse_wheel_tabswitche": true,
  "Seti_no_bar_undertabs": true,

  // don't enable all at once
  "Seti_tabs_small": true,
  "Seti_tabs_med": true,

  // don't enable all at once
  "Seti_ClosedFolder_same": true,
  "Seti_ClosedFolder_remove": true,
  "Seti_ClosedFolder_dots": true,
}
```

- copy the (fold.png) "or edit it if you want" to (Packages/Theme - Default) to override the _focken default yellow icon.

- for better recognition of files types, its recommended to install [Applyâ€‹Syntax](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/ApplySyntax) by facelessuser.

  |-Ext         > copy the content of this folder to your 'Packages/User' folder so (Extensions/Files) can recognize their correct language/icons.

  |-File_Types  > are for testing the icons with, if you don't need it you can simply remove it.

  |-Not_Working > are icon setting files for some files which i don't currently have any '?-syntax.tmlanguage' for, so again if you don't need any of them you can remove it as well.
